# Windows Subsystem for Linux Settings

These are a few config files to make it easier for me to use the same settings
for Bash on Windows on several machines.

It should work on regular Ubuntu as well, and probably most Linux distributions.

## Prerequisites

You should have the following installed allready

* vim
* git
* zsh
* tmux
* mc
* curl
* neofetch

If not:
sudo apt install vim git zsh tmux mc curl neofetch
