# Windows Subsystem for Linux Settings

These are a few config files to make it easier for me to use the same settings
for Bash on Windows on several machines.

It should work on regular Ubuntu as well, and probably most Linux distributions.

## Prerequisites

You should have the following installed allready

* vim
* git
* zsh
* tmux
* mc
* curl
* fastfetch (<https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch>)

If not:
sudo apt install vim git zsh tmux mc curl neofetch

Fastfetch for Ubuntu 22.04 or newer:

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zhangsongcui3371/fastfetch && \
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install fastfetch
```

Otherwise download binary from github releases.
